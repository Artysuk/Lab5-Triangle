GTv1 and GTv12
What is different regarding number of tests, code coverage, and
EC coverage?

GTv1
Test Coverage:
Class: 100%
Method: 100%
Line: 81%

GTv12
Test Coverage:
Class: 100%
Method: 100%
Line: 98%

Number of Tests
GTv1: Contains 16 test methods.
GTv12: Contains 20 test methods.

Code Coverage
GTv1: Tests a variety of scenarios including both valid and invalid dates, transitions between months, and edge cases with negative and unrealistic date values.
GTv12: Similarly includes tests for valid and invalid dates, but also adds tests for leap years and end-of-year transitions.

Equivalence Class (EC) Coverage
GTv1 covers invalid dates, such as negative values or impossible dates, and transitions between days and months. It does not explicitly test leap years.
GTv12 adds coverage for leap years (e.g., testCreatesNextDate12 checks February 28th in a leap year) and some boundary conditions (e.g., testCreatesNextDate8 for the transition from December 31st to January 1st).
