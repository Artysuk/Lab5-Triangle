GTv1
Test Coverage:
Class: 100% (Based on the screenshot, assumed because the test class itself was executed)
Method: 100% (Assuming all methods of NextDate were invoked by the test cases)
Line: 87%

Equivalence Class (EC) Coverage Comparison

Covered by MTv1:
Transition from June to July (testJuneToJuly).
Transition from March to April (testMarchToApril).
Transition from December to the next year (testDecemberToJanuary), testing a boundary condition but with an invalid future year (2021) according to the NextDate restrictions.
Leap year date transition (testLeapYear), which is not properly implemented in NextDate as the leap year function is commented out.

Covered by GTv1:
Tests with various edge cases including invalid dates (such as testRunWithNegative and dates with days that exceed the maximum for a month like in testCreatesNextDate10).
Tests for valid date transitions at the end of months and for different years.
Some tests with arbitrary, nonsensical dates to check the robustness against completely invalid input.

Overlaps and Differences

Overlap: Both suites test the transition from the end of one month to the beginning of the next month, as seen in testJuneToJuly (MTv1) and testCreatesNextDate5 (GTv1).

Differences:
MTv1: Tests for specific date transitions, including leap year handling
GTv1: Includes a wider variety of tests, including many invalid inputs and more robustness checks.

Defect-Detection Effectiveness and Code Coverage
MTv1's targeted approach may miss some edge cases but focuses on critical date transitions, including leap years, which could reveal significant bugs due to the missing functionality in NextDate.
GTv1's broader approach with more tests and various invalid inputs might reveal more issues in the input validation logic but may not focus enough on critical functional scenarios, compared to MTv1.

Relationship Between Measures
They have kind of a needable relationships where GTv1 can check all the general test,
but the MTv1 can check some specific cases, which is needed, of course.

Number of Tests
GTv1 has a larger number of tests than MTv1, but tests are rather general than specific.
MTv1's smaller, targeted suite focuses on the critical functionalities, as per the program specification.
